## Structural Design Pattern
### Definition
A Structural design pattern proposes a way of composing objects for creating new functionality.  
It serves as a blueprint for how different classes and objects are combined to form larger structures.  
In other words, they are patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize  
relationships between entities.  

Class Patterns: describe how inheritance can be used to provide more useful program interfaces.  
Object Patterns: describe how objects can be composed into larger structures using object  
composition, or the inclusion of objects within other objects.
