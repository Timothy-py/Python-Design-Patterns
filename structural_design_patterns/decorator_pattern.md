## The Decorator Pattern
### Definition
This is a structural pattern which allows a programmer to add responsibilites  
or new behaviors to an object dynamically, and in a transparent manner (without  
affecting other objects).  
A Python decorator is a callable (function, method, or class) that gets a function  
object, say, func_in, as input, and returns another function object, say, func_out.  
It is a commonly used technique for extending the behavior of a function,  
method, or class without using inheritance.
