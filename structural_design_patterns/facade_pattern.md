## The Facade Pattern
### Definition
The facade design pattern helps to hide the internal complexity of systems and expose only  
what is necessary to the client through a simplified interface. In essence, facade is an  
abstraction layer implemented over an existing complex system.

### Real-world examples
* A key used to turn on on a car can be considered as a facade. It is a simple  
way of activating a system that is very complex internally.
* A washing machine interface which internally wash the clothe, spin the clothe  
and finally rinse the clothe.
* Turning a laptop computer on with a single button.

### Use cases
The most usual reason to use the facade design pattern is for providing a single, simple  
entry point to a complex system.
